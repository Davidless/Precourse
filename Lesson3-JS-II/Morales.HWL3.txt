* `for` - for loops are similar to the "if" statement in that they will iterate over a variable using other expressions to find a false solution.
* `&&`, `||`, `!` - double ampersand is "and", long bars is "or" and the exclamation is "NOT", essentially meaning the opposite value.
* Arrays - arrays consist of multiple data points that can be accessed from anywhere in the code as long as the array exists in the global scope.
